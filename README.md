# JavaScript Editorüìù

Welcome to the JavaScript Editor, a sleek and powerful web-based tool for loading, editing, and submitting JavaScript code dynamically. Whether you're a developer testing snippets, a student learning JavaScript, or a professional building dynamic scripts, this editor is designed to make your workflow seamless and efficient.

## What Does It Do? ü§î

This project provides a feature-rich JavaScript editor with the following capabilities:

### Load JavaScript Code:
- Fetch JavaScript code from any URL and load it directly into the editor.
- Perfect for testing or modifying external scripts.

### Edit JavaScript Code:
- Use the **Monaco Editor** (the same editor powering VS Code) for a smooth and familiar coding experience.
- Features syntax highlighting, auto-formatting, and more.

### Submit JavaScript Code:
- Submit the edited or newly written JavaScript code to a server endpoint.
- Ideal for dynamic script updates, API testing, or backend integrations.

## Why Use This? üí°

- **Dynamic Code Loading:** Fetch and edit JavaScript code from any URL.
- **Powerful Editor:** Built with Monaco Editor for a professional coding experience.
- **Easy Submission:** Submit JavaScript code to any server endpoint with a single click.
- **Modern UI:** Sleek, dark-themed design with a responsive layout.
- **Developer-Friendly:** Simple setup, clean code, and easy-to-use interface.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

### Load JavaScript:
1. Enter a URL in the **Load URL** field and click **Load JavaScript**.
2. The editor will fetch and display the JavaScript code.

### Edit JavaScript:
- Use the **Monaco Editor** to modify or write new JavaScript code.

### Submit JavaScript:
1. Enter a URL in the **Submit URL** field and click **Submit JavaScript**.
2. The editor will send the code to the specified endpoint and display the server's response.
